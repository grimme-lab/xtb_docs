Community resources
===================

This space is reserved for community developed tooling around *xtb*, *crest* and others.
Here we want to highlight frameworks and programs that depend or build on the methods implemented in *xtb*, interfaces which connect *xtb* with other quantum chemistry programs, or tools that make *xtb* available for special applications.


.. note::

   This section is currently under construction.
   Many great projects building on *xtb* are still missing.
   We appreciate any help with filling in the gaps.
