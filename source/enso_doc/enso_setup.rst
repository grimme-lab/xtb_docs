Setting up ENSO
===============

Setup
=====


Make sure that python3 is installed on your system. Place the program *enso.py* in your /home/$USER/bin/ folder and add this folder to your PATH. Make the python program executable:

.. code:: sh
   
   > chmod u+x /home/$USER/bin/enso.py

To setup ``ENSO`` place your global configuration file *.ensorc* in your /home/$USER folder. If you should not have a global configuration file, you can create it by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    > enso.py -write_ensorc 

This creates the file *ensorc_new* which you then have to move to your home directory and adjust to your needs:

.. code-block:: sh

    > mv ensorc_new ~/.ensorc

It is mandatory for `enso` to find the correct paths to your programs within your  global configuration file *.ensorc*:

.. code-block:: text
  
    > cat ~/.ensorc
    .ENSORC

                    | are dismissed. Our recommendation is to set this threshold to 4.0 kcal/mol. 
part2_threshold     | All conformers below this threshold (in kcal/mol) are considered for the high level

                    | 2.0 kcal/mol.
sm                  | Solvation model employed for the optimization in *Part1* und *Part2*. Not all solvation

smgsolv2            | In *Part2* first the full optimization is performed using the solvent model specified
                    | in *sm*. Then the low level free energy calculation is performed (still *Part2*)

                    | solvation model can be choosen. This makes sence, if this solvation model is then 
                    | used in the high level free energy calculation *Part3* too. [options: sm, cosmors]
sm3                 | solvation model employed in the high level free energy calculation *Part3*. 
                    | we recommend to use the same solvation model as in *smgsolv2*. [options: cosmors,

                    | [options: on, off]
crestcheck          | The conformers  could become identical or rotamers of each other during the full 
                    | DFT optimization (*Part2*). Therefore we use ``CREST`` to identify identical 
                    | conformers or rotamers. The *crestcheck* option (on) can automatically remove 
                    | identical conformers and rotamers. If it is set to off, the check is still run
                    | but the user is only informed and has to remove the conformers manually after
                    | inspection. Our recommendation is to sort out conformers manually (option: off)
                    | since the sorting alogrithm is threshold based. [options: on, off]
maxthreads          | Number of threads the ENSO program can use. (maxthreads * omp = number of cores)
                    | e.g. the maximal number of calculations that can run in parallel.
                    | Make sure that the number of cores does not exceed your machine
omp                 | specification. Number of cores each thread (set with *maxthreads*)
                    | has available. e.g. maxthreads = 2 and omp = 3 would use two threads 
                    | using each three cores, the total number of cores in use would be six. 
reference for 1H    | Reference for calculating the shifts of your 1H spectrum.
                    | This is written to the file .anmrrc. [options: TMS, DSS]
reference for 13C   | Reference for calculating the 13C shifts of your spectrum.
                    | This information is written to the file .anmrrc. [options: TMS, DSS]
1H active           | Calculate NMR properties for the 1H nuclei. [options: on, off]

NMR-property calculations
=========================


Information about the basis sets employed (default) for NMR property calculations:

* Jensen (ORCA)
* def2-TZVP (TURBOMOLE)

For user convenience shielding values of the reference molecules (TMS, DSS ...) were precalculated
and stored within the `enso` program. The reference shielding values are used in the `anmr`
program to calculate the shifts and the reference values are written to the file *.anmrrc*.

To be consistent with your calculation, the reference shielding values were calculated on the
reference molecules with all possible geometry-optimization-settings eg. {TURBOMOLE/ORCA, PBEh-3c /
TPSS-D3/def2-TZVP / B97-3c, (gas phase or solvent)}. The shieldings were then calculated either with
TPSS or PBE0 and depending on ORCA (gas or CPCM and pcSseg-2 Jensen basis set) or TURBOMOLE (gas or
COSMO with the def2-TZVP basis set). At the end of part4 the file *.anmrrc* is written into the
calculation folder and stores the reference shielding values of your settings for the subsequent
*ANMR* calculation.

.. note:: The `enso` program only writes the reference shielding values to the file '.anmrrc' but 
      does not do anything with it. Hence, no results of `enso` are influenced 
      by a non-matching reference value. If you want to change the reference shielding values, 
      you can simply modify the file '.anmrrc' before calling `anmr` program.
