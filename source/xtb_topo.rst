.. _xtb_topo:

--------------------
 Topology Submodule
--------------------

.. note::
   This feature is only present in version 6.3 and newer

The topology submodule allows to create a GFN-FF topology from a geometry
input, which can be used to restart a calculation with the GFN-FF without
having to perform a costly reevaluation of the force field topology

To start the generation use

.. code-block:: text

   xtb topo [--namspace <name>] <geometry>

If you want to use a particular namespace in the calculation later include
the namespace flag.
Note that even if you want to perform several GFN-FF calculation on different
namespaces, generate the topology file without a namespace is recommend,
as ``xtb`` will first search the local namespace and than fall back to the
default file name to finding the generated topology file.

.. important::
   The force field generation step is a cubic scaling step as it requires
   an all pair shortest path (APSP) algorithm for generating the topological
   charges and for the diagonalization of the HÃ¼ckel matrices for the
   torsion potentials, which can take, depending on the system of interest
   a significant portion of computation time.

The generated file will be named ``gfnff_topo`` or ``<name>.gfnff_topo`` and
can become quite large.
