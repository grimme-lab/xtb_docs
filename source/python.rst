 Python Integration for the xtb API
------------------------------------

The ``xtb`` program does not provide a Python API on its own anymore,
it is now maintained in the ``xtb-python`` project.

The ``xtb-python`` project is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb-python>`_.
The documention of the Python API can be found `here <https://xtb-python.readthedocs.io>`_.
