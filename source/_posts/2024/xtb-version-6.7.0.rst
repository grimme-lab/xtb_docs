==========================

We are happy to release a new version of ``xtb``.
This version introduced several powerful features and enhancements, including the new CPCM-X solvation model, support for periodic boundary conditions in GFN-FF, and an implementation of dipole moments within the GFN-FF framework. 
A range of computational methods was added or refined, such as the Dimer Projection (DIPRO) method, PTB (Density Tight-Binding) potential, and support for Raman activity calculations with user-defined wavelength and temperature. 
External-driver optimization was improved through automatic writing of updated coordinate files and better output formatting. 
Users also gained access to new features like the sandwich potential model, total-atom constraints, and COSMO file output in TM convention.
