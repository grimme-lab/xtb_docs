==========================

We are happy to a bugfix release of ``xtb``.
Please note that due to the deprecation of the C++ compiler, the Windows version is 6.7.1pre, as the compilation excluded C-API tests for xtb and CPCM-X and used the previous version of dftd4 (v3.4.0). 
In the next release, we will likely fully switch to the icx-cl compiler.

Many thanks to Sebastian Ehlert (@awvwgk), Igor S. Gerasimov(@foxtran), Thomas Rose (@Thomas3R) for contributing to this release. Special thanks to Marcel Stahn (@MtoLStoN) who made the compilation of the Windows version possible.
