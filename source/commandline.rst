 Commandline Usage
-------------------

For ``xtb`` we usually enjoy to build our workflows via commandline,
so most tasks can be performed without ever writing any kind of input file
(except for the geometry input, of course).
The man page can be found `here <https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb/blob/master/man/xtb.1.adoc>`_.

.. note:: If you need more control you should resort to the :ref:`detailed-input`
          file.

Runtypes
========

The most basic flags used in ``xtb`` are the runtypes. We have a bunch of
them, but many of the elaborate composite runtypes are constructed from
four basic runtypes: singlepoint (SP), geometry optimization (ANCopt),
frequency calculation (Hessian) and molecular dynamics (MD).
Every calculation performs the basic setup and at some (resonable) point
a property calculation.

Singlepoint
   :flag: ``--scc``
   :description:
     just self-consistent charge (SCC) calculation.
     See :ref:`sp` for details.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties

Gradient

     than removes an electron to perform another SCC calculation.

Vertical EA
   :flag: ``--vea``
   :description:
     vertical electron affinity (EA), calculates SCC on input structure and
     than adds an electron to perform another SCC calculation.

     setup, SP, SP, properties

Vertical IP and EA
   :flag: ``--vipea``
   :description:
     both IP and EA are calculate by removing and adding an electron, 
     respectively.

Global Electrophilicity Index

     calculates Mulliken partial charges from the neutral, positive and
     negatively charged structure and calculates Fukui indices.

STM picture
   :flag: ``--stm``
   :description:
     simulate a STM measurement (molecule should be aligned to xy-plane)
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties (with STM calculation)

Geometry optimization
   :flag: ``--opt``
   :description:
     approximate normal coordinate optimization, performs an initial singlepoint
     calculation and a final singlepoint calculation on the optimized structure.
     See :ref:`geometry optimization` for details.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, ANCopt, SP, properties

Minimum Hopping
   :flag: ``--metaopt``
   :description:
     try to find conformers by geometry optimization, for each minimum located
     a bias potential is generated to push the optimizer to another local minimum.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, ANCopt, SP, properties, ANCopt, ...

Guided Path Finder
   :flag: ``--path [file]``
   :description:
     apply a bias potential between the input and final geometry (from `file`)
     and force the geometry optimizer to generate a path between the two structures.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties, ANCopt, ...

Modefollowing
   :flag: ``--modef mode``
   :description:
     follow ``mode`` which specifies the nth eigenmode from a previously done
     frequency calculation.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties, ANCopt, ...

Frequency calculation
   :flag: ``--[o]hess``
   :description:

Metadynamics
   :flag: ``--metadyn [snapshots]``
   :description:
     activates metadynamics simulation on start geometry, where
     ``snapshots`` is the number of structures from the trajectory
     should be used in the biasing potential.
     See :ref:`mtd` for details.
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties, MD

Simulated annealing
   :flag: ``--siman``
   :description:
     performs a number of simulated annealing steps on the input
     coordinates and tries to find a conformer ensemble.
     We recommend the CREST workflow (see :ref:`crest`) instead of this runtyp
     since it is faster and more reliable in finding the lowest conformer.
     **This runtyp has been deprecated and removed in version 6.2!**
   :queue:
     setup, SP, properties, MD, ANCopt, ...
