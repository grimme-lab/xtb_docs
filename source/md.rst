 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
-------------------------------

In this chapter, all necessary information will be given in order
to perform MD simulations with xTB. 
The adjustable parameters will be discussed and a guide to how to change
them will be given.

General command-line control
============================

There are two main possibilities how to evoke a MD simulation.
With the flag ``--omd`` geometry optimization will be performed
and this structure then will be used for the MD simulation, a loose
optimization level will be chosen.

.. code:: bash

  > xtb coord --omd
    
By using the flag ``--md`` the MD simulation will be performed directly with the user given input structure.

.. code:: bash

  > xtb coord --md

It is strongly recommended to start the MD simulation from an xTB
optimized structure. 
Otherwise there may be instabilities during the MD and the equilibration
will be severely hindered. 

Parameters
==========

In order to change the parameters of the MD simulation the ``$md`` block
in the input file has to be modified.

  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  |  key    | value   | default   | description                             |
  +=========+=========+===========+=========================================+
  | dump    | real    | 50 fs     | interval for trajectory printout        |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | hmass   | integer | 4 times   | mass of hydrogen atoms                  |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | nvt     | boolean | true      | perform simulation in NVT ensemble      |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | restart | boolean | false     | read velocities from ``mdrestart``      |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | temp    | real    | 298.15 K  | thermostat temperature                  |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | time    | real    | 50 ps     | total run time of simulation            |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | sccacc  | real    | 2.0       | accuracy of xTB calculation in dynamics |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | shake   | integer | 2         | use SHAKE algorithm to constrain bonds  |
  +         +         +           +                                         +
  |         |         |           | 0 = off, 1 = X-H only, 2 = all bonds    |   
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | step    | real    | 4 fs      | time step for propagation               |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
  | velo    | boolean | false     | also write out velocities               |
  +---------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+

The above default setting should look like below in your input file

.. code::

   $md
      temp=298.15 # in K
      time= 50.0  # in ps
      dump= 50.0  # in fs
      step=  4.0  # in fs
      velo=false
      nvt =true
      hmass=4
      shake=2
      sccacc=2.0
   $end

.. important :: 
   For MD simulations with GFN-FF the time step must be reduced, for more information see section :ref:`gfnff`

MD specific Files
=================

After the ``xtb`` program has performed the desired MD simulation the trajectory of the structures can be found in ``xtb.trj``.
Furthermore, files with the names ``scoord.*`` are generated. After every picosecond of simulation the structure at this point will be written into these files. After a successful completion of the MD simulation a ``xtbmdok`` file will be touched. The structure and velocities at the end of the simulation will be written into a ``mdrestart`` file.

Trajectory
----------
The number of structures in the ``xtb.trj`` file depends on the ``dump`` variable and the propagation time step.
For practical purposes the two parameters are converted into a dump frequency *n* = (dump step/time step), e.g.,
a structure is written to the trajecotry equidistantly at every *n*-th propagation step. 
Due to this conversion the total number of structures in the ``xtb.trj`` file might be slightly larger
than the expected (total runtime/dump step).
The same applies to the ``scoord.*`` files.

Restart
-------
The ``mdrestart`` file can be used to restart an MD simulation. The file consists of 6 columns. The initial three columns represent the atom coordinates, followed by their corresponding velocities, both given in atomic units. 
Please note that the atoms retain the same order as in the input geometry file.
This can be very helpful for equilibration purposes. 
In order to achive this, in the ``$md`` block the ``restart`` parameter has to be set to ``true``.

.. code::

   > cat restart.inp
   $md
    restart=true

In this case, you will find the **RESTART** printed in the ``xtb`` output. 

Example/Case study
------------------

To summarize the most important topics of this chapter we will perform an MD simulation of the ethane molecule with `xTB`.
Make sure that ``xtb`` is properly set up and you have the following files in your working directory

.. code::

 > cat coord
 $coord
  1.82409443250962  -0.02380488009596  0.17250251620479  c
  4.68095348739630  -0.02380488009596  0.17250308312263  c
  1.09744635742609   1.41159121722257 -1.12629926294082  h
  1.09744579050825   0.38329239564274  2.06499275150500  h
  1.09744635742609  -1.86629844212581 -0.42118612892243  h
  5.40760175145245   1.81868868193389  0.76619172824984  h
  5.40760212939767  -0.43090215583466 -1.71998734115020  h
  5.40760175145245  -1.45920097741449  1.47130486226824  h
 $end
 > cat md.inp
 $md
  time=10
  step=1
  temp=500
  shake=1

As you can see, we will run the simulation for 10 ps with a timestep of 1 fs at a temperature of 500 Kelvin. Furthermore, all hydrogen-containing bonds will be constrained using the *SHAKE* algorithm. To start the simulation we call xtb as follows

.. code:: bash

 > xtb coord --input md.inp --omd

The program will start with performing a geometry optimization,
the optimized structure used to start the dynamic can be found
and inspected in ``xtbopt.coord``.

In the file ``xtb.trj`` we can find our trajectory. We can analyze the structures now by displaying them in a molecular graphics editor (e.g., `MOLDEN`_, `VMD`_ etc. ) or a trajectory analyzer (e.g. `TRAVIS`_).
