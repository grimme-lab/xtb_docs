.. _crestcmd:

-------------------------------
 CREST command line arguments
-------------------------------

.. contents::


``CREST`` is usually invoked via commandline, and requires only a coordinate input file.
The program supports the ``TURBOMOLE`` coordinates (coord, Bohr), Xmol (`*`.xyz, Angstroem)
or 3d SDF (V2000,V3000) formats and can be called via

.. code:: bash

   > crest [INPUT] [OPTIONS]
   
If no file is given as ``[INPUT]``, then ``CREST`` automatically searches for a file called *coord*
in the ``TURBOMOLE`` format. Either must be present. The different ``[OPTIONS]`` are listed below and refer
to ``Version 2.11`` of the ``CREST`` code. ``[DEFAULT]`` options do not need to be specified explicitly.

Runtypes
========

Several different applications are availabile within the ``CREST`` program.
The most important usage are the two different conformational search algorithms MF-MD-GC and iMTD-GC,
but there are also some smaller utility tools that can be used, such as an CRE sorting function (CREGEN),
or a standalone z-martix sorting function (ZSORT).
The different runtypes are:

    * - MTD-GC algorithm (outdated)
      - ``--v2``
      - Second generation of the GFN\ *n*-xTB driven conformational search algorithm, consisting out of a meta-dynamics approach and genetic structure crossing.
    * - iMTD-GC algorithm ``[DEFAULT]``

Ensemble sorting
================

    * - ``--ewin <REAL>``
      - Set the energy threshold to *REAL* kcal/mol. This affects several runtypes and the ``[DEFAULT]`` is depending on the application (6 kcal/mol conformational searches, 30 kcal/mol screening tools).
    * - ``--prsc``
      - Create a scoord.`*` file for each conformer in the ``TURBOMOLE`` format.
    * - ``--rthr <REAL>``
      - Set RMSD threshold in Ångström. The ``[DEFAULT]`` is 0.125 Å.
    * - ``--ethr <REAL>``
      - Set energy threshold between conformer pairs in kcal/mol. The ``[DEFAULT]`` is 0.05 kcal/mol.
    * - ``--bthr <REAL>``
      - Set lower bound for the rotational constant threshold to *REAL*. The ``[DEFAULT]`` is 0.01 (= 1%). The thresold is dynamically adjusted between this value and 2.5%, based on the anisotropy of the rotational constants.
    * - ``--nmr, --eqv, --entropy``
      - Activate determination and printout of NMR-equivalencies. Writes the files ``anmr_rotamer`` and ``anmr_nucinfo``, which are required by the ``ENSO`` python script.
    * - ``--athr <REAL>``
      - Similarity threshold to determine internal rotation of equal atoms for NMR. The ``[DEFAULT]`` is 0.04.
    * - ``-temp <REAL>``
      - Set temperature for the calculation of Boltzmann weights. The ``[DEFAULT]`` is 298.15 K.

    * - ``--subrmsd``

    * - ``--notopo``

An extension to the CREGEN sorting is an automatic principle component analysis (PCA) and
k-Means sorting clustering algorithm. It can be invoked with the ``--cluster`` command.

.. list-table::

    * - Flag
      - Description
    * - ``--cluster <INT>``
      - Perform a clustering on the final CREGEN ensemble to identify *INT* most representative structures, based on dihedral angles. Note that this algorithm currently does not work well for non-covalent complexes or molecular clusters and should only be applied to singular molecules.
