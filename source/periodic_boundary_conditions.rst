 Periodic Boundary Conditions
------------------------------

We integrated the xTB methods in `DFTB+`_ to allow reusing the existing code infrastructure for handling periodic boundary condition.
Implementation of the xTB methods is realized via a library spin-off from ``xtb``, which will be upstreamed into this project in the future.
For more details on the integration visit this `page <https://tblite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/dftbplus.html>`_.
